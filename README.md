After you set up your username, email address, you need to create a personal access token (PAT).
This is described here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
Once you have access token, you can then do
$ git push
Username: <my-username wjantispam>
Password: <my-personal-access-token>
